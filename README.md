Remote sensing topics with python

### Author message:
Hi! :wave: Welcome to this repository! :bowtie: 

The objective of this repository is to use and explore the **basic concepts** of **remote sensing** using `python language`, presenting some of the most known processing methods in the world of **space technology**. Therefore, I try to bring simple geoprocessing practices and visualization of **satellite images**.

In addition, some notebooks have examples of how to calculate most common **spectral indices** using satellite imagery. Thus, I try to address relevant topics to assess **environmental subjects**. :deciduous_tree: :palm_tree: :evergreen_tree:

I hope you can somehow take advantage of the resources available here. So, let's explore several topics in remote sensing and work with **our planet!** :earth_americas:
